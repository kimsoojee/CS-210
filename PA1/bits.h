/* This header is separate from features.h so that the compiler can
   include it implicitly at the start of every compilation.  It must
   not itself include <features.h> or any other header that includes
   <features.h> because the implicit include comes before any feature
   test macros that may be defined in a source file before it first
   explicitly includes a system header.  GCC knows the name of this
   header in order to preinclude it.  */
/* glibc's intent is to support the IEC 559 math functionality, real
   and complex.  If the GCC (4.9 and later) predefined macros
   specifying compiler intent are available, use them to determine
   whether the overall intent is to support these features; otherwise,
   presume an older compiler has intent to support these features and
   define these macros by default.  */
/* wchar_t uses Unicode 7.0.0.  Version 7.0 of the Unicode Standard is
   synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646:2012, plus Amendments 1 (published
   on April, 2013) and 2 (not yet published as of February, 2015).
   Additionally, it includes the accelerated publication of U+20BD
   RUBLE SIGN.  Therefore Unicode 7.0.0 is between 10646:2012 and

   published.  */
